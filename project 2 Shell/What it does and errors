 The main focus of this project is to implement 
 (1) three Unix ﬁle system–related commands (cd, du, and grep) and 
 (2) a unix shell which is capable of executing any Unix commands. 
 Moreover, the shell should be able to handle redirection and pipes in addition to executing the commands.
 
 Our redirection was simple and works mainly to output files.
 the du command does not work on directories that are extremely large such as the root folder. 
 It will work on fairly large directories such as your User folder.
 
Other errors are
Seg fault if the file is not present when running grep

Not able to run commands that are not in /bin like gcc
This one was an oversight, I will add this in the future

Not printing command error when a bad command is entered

File created in redirection cannot be opened without changing permissions
