This is a simple client server example using sockets and 2 clients
cli1 and cli2 are simply test code object files I wrote. You can run them but they won't do much.
They are required because ftok requires a filepath.

Open run server first before running either client.
When you reply with a client the server does not print anything. 
This is a design choice because it was 2am and I mistakenly read the instructions wrong. 
Since printing server side is the same as client side, I don't feel the need to copy paste it.
